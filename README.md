# AI & Blockchain Final Project 
DEPRECARED: we would no longer update this repo, and the project has been moved to https://github.com/AI-and-Blockchain/F22_Federated_Learning_With_Flexible_Labels

A Decentralized AI Architecture for Training an Ensemble Model With Flexible Labels


## TODO
	1. AI Component:
	    * Create a custom loss function to minimize false positives
	    * 
	
	2. Federated Learning:
	    * Implement asynchronous model parameters (at least, list of numbers and strings) sharing
	    * 
	
	3. Blockchain Component:
	    * Create smart contracts to ensure data sharing 
	    *
